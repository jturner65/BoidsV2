# BoidsV2
Updated version of old boids project using my UI window code.  also, with the ability to add multiple (up to 5) different species of boids, visualize from "on the deck" of any of the boid ships, simplify rendering by representing all boids as spheres, and more.

Videos of the old project can be found here :
